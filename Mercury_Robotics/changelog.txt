		DC class
			- added bool prev_dir_ variable to hold the last direction used
			- added prev_dir() function to return prev_dir_
			- prev_dir_ is set in drive()

	2/11/2016 (Barrow)
		DC class
			- added DC class to control the DC motor
			- added drive() function to move a motor forwards or backwards at a set pwm
			- added normalize() function to normalize controller value to the pwm (0 - 255)
		namespace servo
			- created namespace servo for "loose" functions
		Servo class
			- placed servo_setup() in the namespace servo
			- added normalize() function in the Servo class to normalize a (0 - 255) number to the servo (MIN - MAX) range
	2/10/2016 (Barrow)
		Servo class
			- renamed the class Servo_Driver to Servo
			- made variables MAX and MIN private and added access functions max() and min() to return their values

		Sonar class
			- added override_ variable of type bool
			- added function set_override() to change override state
